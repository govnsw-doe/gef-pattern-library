  ## Example
  * [Template](http://dec-ce.bitbucket.org/gef/master/template-news-article.html)
  * [Template (Education)](http://dec-ce.bitbucket.org/gef-education-theme/test/template-news-article.html)

  ## Usage
  * The template supports two ways of grouping news articles:
    * By category - high-level groupings, for example: case studies, events
    * By tag - themes within a news article content
  * The main content area can display general typographic elements (eg bulleted lists, tables).
  * Each news article should be associated with a representative image (sized at 1000 px × 562 px). This image appears in the main content column.
  * The user can select the category or tag at the bottom of the news article to view other similar articles.
  * Squiz Matrix users:
    * A news article can belong to one category but can be assigned multiple tags.
    * This template needs to be pre-configured before it’s available for use. Please contact platform administrators for more information.
    * Additional content in the sidebar (see below news categories) must be set up by platform administrators.
