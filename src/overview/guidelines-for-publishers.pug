  In most web projects at the department, much of the content will be developed by the business unit or team that owns the subject area. This quick guide helps authors and publishers to use the appropriate patterns based on their content needs as well as the needs of their users.

  ### Scenario 1
  > I have lots of content that needs to stay on one page so users can see highly related content in one place.

  Use:
  * [Anchor box](/components/anchor-box.html)

  ### Scenario 2
  > How do I create distinct groups of content in a page so users can consider each block in a meaningful way?

  Use:
  * [Show/hide](/components/show-hide.html)
  * [Tabs](/components/tabs.html)


  ### Scenario 3
  > How do I create distinct groups of content in a page so users can consider each block in a meaningful way?

  Use:
  * [Call-out box](/components/call-out-box.html)

  ### Scenario 4
  > I have content that needs to be accessible from every page so users can have quick access to this section&rsquo;s key info and tasks.

  Use:
  * [Local footer](/components/local-footer.html)

  ### Scenario 5
  > I have a collection of content items for users to browse and compare.

  Use:
  * [Catalogue](/templates/catalogue.html)

  ### Scenario 6
  > How can I make periodic announcements so users can be informed about changes in this section?

  Use:

  * [News article](/templates/news-article.html)

  ### Scenario 7
