  Anchor boxes are dynamically generated based on the H2 headings on the page. This makes them particularly useful for navigating long content pages.

  ## Usage
  * Be aware of the number of H2 headings on the content page as they will be automatically listed in the anchor box.
  * Use the anchor box as a navigation tool for short FAQ content. You can do this by presenting each question as an H2 heading.
  * Squiz Matrix users: anchor boxes automatically appear on standard content pages that contain three or more H2 headings. You can choose to disable them.

  ## Accessibility notes
  * Use <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to enter the anchor box.
  * <kbd>TAB</kbd> to move through the list of links.
  * <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to select a link. This will cause the page to jump to the related heading. The next <kbd>TAB</kbd> should focus on content under the heading.
