  ## Usage
  * Be aware of the number of H2 headings on the content page as they will be automatically listed in the anchor box.
  * Use the anchor box as a navigation tool for short FAQ content. You can do this by presenting each question as an H2 heading.
  * Squiz Matrix users: anchor boxes automatically appear on standard content pages that contain three or more H2 headings. You can choose to disable them.
