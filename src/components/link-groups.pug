  ## Usage
  * Link groups provide a way to reveal and highlight key content from a section&rsquo;s information architecture so that likely audience groups can find them more easily.
  * Choose an appropriate title for the link group to describe the type of links it contains.
  * Lists in a link group should form a unified whole, ie do not mix different types of lists.
  * A link group can support 3 or 4 lists of links.
  * Each list has a title, generally the audience name.
  * Each list can contain up to 5 links.
  * Suggested link groups: popular information, key tasks, common systems.
  * Squiz Matrix users:
    * Link groups are only available on the section homepage template.
    * Each list&rsquo;s title is automatically prefixed with the label &ldquo;For&rdquo;.
